# Linear Regression: Salary Prediction
Hello there! This is a supervised machine learning project completed early in my journey as a data scientist. I wanted to know what the data might reveal about compensation in the field. Can you blame me for being curious? :monkey:

The goal was to construct a predictive regression model achieving the highest R^2 possible. Spoiler alert: it does not go very high in this project. But I did get some neat interpretations (take a look at page 8 of the presentation PDF). 

I used cross-validation as my model selection method amongst the various models evaluated:
1. Simple linear regression
2. Ridge regression
3. LASSO
4. Polynomial regression

The dataset is comprised of ~650 observations which includes salary data and metadata that I web-scraped with the help of Beautiful Soup and Selenium from:
* Levels.fyi (salary data)
* Salary.com (cost of living data)
* Wikipedia.com (company data)

## Jupyter Notebooks for your perusal:
1. EDA (exploratory data analysis)
2. Linear Regression modeling

Thanks for visiting!
